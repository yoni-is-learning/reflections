How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the
bug that was introduced?

    I saw that lines were added and removed. That helped flag possible
    sources of error

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you
a more efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can cross what I know about when things "started to go wrong"
    with thechange that was made.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to
create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically
saved, like Google docs does?

    Pros: only "logical" breakpoints are recorded as commits. Cons:
    user error, not saving enough

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving
multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat
each file separately?

    Systems that allow multiple files to be saved at once are ones
    where multiple files have a dependecy on each other

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history
of files?

    Git diff allows comparing two versions of the same file from
    different time points. It allows to see which lines were deleted
    and which were added

How might using version control make you more confident to make
changes that could break something?

    Can always go back to older versions

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using
Git for?
